## Core Components

### 1. Video Processing Pipeline
- **Video Preprocessor**: Frame extraction, normalization, quality enhancement
- **Object Detection**: Detect players, ball, referee, goal posts using YOLO/R-CNN
- **Action Recognition**: Identify actions (kick, pass, tackle, shot) using 3D CNN
- **Scene Analysis**: Field segmentation, camera angle detection

### 2. Game Intelligence
- **Player Tracking**: Multi-object tracking across frames
- **Event Detection**: Goal, foul, corner kick, offside detection
- **Game State Analysis**: Score tracking, possession, field position

### 3. Commentary Generation
- **Event Classifier**: Categorize detected events by importance and type
- **Commentary Generator**: LLM-based text generation with context awareness
- **Text-to-Speech**: High-quality voice synthesis with emotion

### 4. Data Management
- **Player Database**: Player names, positions, statistics
- **Commentary Templates**: Pre-defined phrases and reaction patterns
- **Game Rules Engine**: Soccer rules and regulations

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3070 or better (for real-time processing)
